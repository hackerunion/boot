- need to ensure perms are started right - currently set to some weird stuff

- investigate js from old hu project

- how do we load dependencies for nested apps?
- how do we handle nested submodules? (maybe updating a submodule requires a pull request - that kinda makes sense; can also add autosync modules... maybe a config file?)
